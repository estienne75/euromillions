This program is named "euromillions" and works with the relational database "MySql" of the company Oragle. The data scheme is named "heureuxmillions" and literally means happymillions in French.

The program is fully written in java and is far from being finalized and realized with the netbeans IDE.

The program is licensed under MIT and may be duplicated, modified, distributed and licensed.

The principle of this program, in the course of evolution, is to work not on probabilities but on a more concrete principle such as cycles of successive draws.

This program does not treat the stars and only concerns the numbers.

A cycle is performed when, starting from a drawing date, the first one for example, the 50 numbers are output after n titrations.

This program proposes to visualize the cycles by date of release or by number of drawing per cycle. It also provides statistics on the occurrence of each issue in a given cycle, a cycle summary, cycle patterns and a validation grid to record one or more games on the official date of the next draw.
